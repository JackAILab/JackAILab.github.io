# 🧍‍♂️ Biography
I received a B.S. degree in Automation from [Nanchang University](https://www.ncu.edu.cn/), Jiangxi, China, in 2022. I am currently working toward an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China.

My research interests include

[**Project**](https://github.com/JackAILab/TMBL) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- Considering that existing multi-modal fusion systems rarely consider fine-grained word-level interactions, we redesigned the Transformer structure, effectively improving the ACC index by 6%. 
- In order to solve the problem of modal heterogeneity caused by multi-modal feature fusion, inspired by CLIP, a cross-model binding mechanism was designed for each modality to more effectively fuse modal features. 
- Aiming at the modal aliasing problem caused by the difficulty in distinguishing modal features, CLS and PositionEmbedding information are designed to effectively distinguish modal space and semantic relationships.
