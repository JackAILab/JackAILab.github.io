# 🧍‍♂️ Biography
I received a B.S. degree in Automation from [Nanchang University](https://www.ncu.edu.cn/), Jiangxi, China, in 2022. I am currently working toward an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China.

My research interests include 
- **[Physics-Informed Machine Learning](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:physics_informed_ml)**
- **[Reliability Engineering](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:reliability_engineering)**
- **[Condition Monitoring](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:condition_monitoring)**
